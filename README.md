# Spam Email Classification

This project uses a Naive Bayes classifier to predict whether an email is spam or not based on a sample dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset can be obtained from Kaggle. You will find various datasets related to email spam detection on Kaggle's website.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harit105/Spam_Email.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Spam_Email
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas,sklearn, numpy
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the dataset downloaded from Kaggle and placed in the appropriate directory.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the code:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open the notebook file and run all cells to train the classifier and make predictions.

## Methodology

This code uses a Naive Bayes classifier to analyze the dataset and predict whether an email is spam or not. The classifier is trained on a sample dataset and then used to classify new emails based on their content.
